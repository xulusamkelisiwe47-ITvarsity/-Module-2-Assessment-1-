                  <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                  <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of
                      infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates,
                      such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.
                      Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live
                      primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
                      Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>

                <p>Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago.
                   New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago.
                   Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago.
                   Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35-32 million years ago],
                   eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists.</p>

                <p>Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates.
                   Like monkeys, tarsiers are haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys</p>
                 
                 <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                 <p>Old World monkeys are found in Africa and Asia. Some examples are guenons, mangabeys, macaques, baboons,
                    and colobus monkeys. New World monkeys are found in Mexico, Central America, and South America.
                    Some examples are woolly monkeys, spider monkeys, howler monkeys, capuchin monkeys, and squirrel monkeys.</p>

                  <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                 <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit
                    the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas,
                    and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates.
                    The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans,
                    from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives
                    to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>

                 <p>Gorillas are the largest non-human primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres,
                     weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres,
                     depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops,
                     with the leader being called a silverback.The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the
                     Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences.
                     Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>

                  <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                  <p>Habitat. Mountain gorillas live in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
                     on green, volcanic mountains. Lowland gorillas live in the forests of central
                     and western Africa in Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
                     Congo, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
